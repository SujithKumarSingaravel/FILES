git init -> to create empty local repository
git add file.txt -> staging
git commit -m "Initial change" -> move to local repo
git branch -M main -> master to main
git checkout branchname -> to switch branches
git branch -a -> show available branches (empty bran also)
git remote add origin (url-repository link) -> to add new origin or repo
git push -u origin main -> to push to remote repo

Merge:
git merge (branchname) -> to merge two branches   

git branch (newbranch) -> to create new branch from terminal
1.create new file 2.push it to newbranch -> then only it will show in github
to merge newbranch with main -> give pull request + boss will review and merge
